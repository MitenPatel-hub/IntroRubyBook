# Intro to Ruby Book - Ch 2 - Variables - Exercise 3

=begin
Add another section onto name.rb that prints the name of the user 10 times. 
You must do this without explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row. 
Hint: you can use the times method to do something repeatedly
I am copying the code from variables_1.arb into this file to keep the exercises better organized for my learning purposes.
=end

puts "What is your name?"
name = gets.chomp 
puts "Hello #{name}, how are you doing today?"
10.times { puts name }

=begin

Model solution:

10.times do
  puts name
end

=end

=begin

Solutions Comparison:

They both look like concise, idiomatic solutions.

1. My solution uses a single line block with curly braces {} to define the loop. 
This is more concise and is considered idiomatic when the block contains only one line of code.
2. My solution takes up fewer lines of code.
This can be an advantage in terms of readability when dealing with simple, short blocks.
3. Model solution uses the do...end syntax for the block.
This is generally preferred when dealing with multi-line blocks.
However, in this case, the block only contains one line of code, so the difference in style is minimal.
4. Model solution takes up more lines of code than Solution 1.
Still, the difference is not significant for this particular problem.
5. Both are great solutions. 

I may be biased but I slightly prefer my solution.
It is more concise while still maintaining readability.
