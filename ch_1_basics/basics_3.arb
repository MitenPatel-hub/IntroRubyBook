# My solution for Exercise 3 for Intro to Ruby - Basics Chapter

=begin
Write a program that uses a hash to store a list of movie titles with the year they came out. 
Then use the puts command to make your program print out the year of each movie to the screen. 
=end

movies = { hercules: 1997, mulan: 1998, tarzan: 1999, fantasia: 1940, bambi: 1942 }

puts movies[:hercules]
puts movies[:mulan]
puts movies[:tarzan]
puts movies[:fantasia]
puts movies[:bambi]

=begin
The above is in line with the model solution. 
However, I know from Codecademy that I can use the solution below with the .each method and passing a block with block variables to access the key-value pairs in the movies hash.
=end

movies.each { |x, y| puts y }
