# My solution for Exercise 1 for Intro to Ruby - Basics Chapter

# Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return a first and last name as a full name in one string.
puts "Miten " + "Patel"

first_name = 'Miten'
last_name = 'Patel'

puts first_name + ' ' + last_name

puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
