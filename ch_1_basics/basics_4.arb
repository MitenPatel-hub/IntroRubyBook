# My solution for Exercise 4 for Intro to Ruby - Basics Chapter

=begin
Use the dates from the previous example and store them in an array. 
Then make your program output the same thing as exercise 3. 
=end

# I'm going to use the same movie dates from Exercise 3, but I'm going to store them in an array instead of a hash.

movie_dates = [1997, 1998, 1999, 1940, 1942] # Initialize an array called dates and place each of the values from our hash as an element in this dates array.

puts movie_dates[0]
puts movie_dates[1]
puts movie_dates[2]
puts movie_dates[3]
puts movie_dates[4]

=begin
The above is in line with the model solution. 
We did this using array element reference, and we accessed the elements of movie_dates array using the element indexes.
This is the same as accessing the values of a hash using the keys because the index values 0..4 are the default keys for the elements in the array.
Syntactically, we use a pair of square brackets and pass in the indexes of the elements that we want to reference. 
For incrementing Integers beginning with the zero-based index, remember that the last index of an array is always going to be one less than its size.

# However, I know from Codecademy that I can also write this more concisely as shown below.
puts movie_dates
